## what is requirement analysis
Requirement analysis is the process of understanding, documenting, and managing software requirements.

**IMPORTANCE OF REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS**
Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## Key activities in requirement analysis

1. Requirement Gathering üóÇÔ∏è
Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.
2. Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è
Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.
3. Requirement Documentation üìö
Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user‚Äôs perspective.
Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.
4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä
Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.
5. Requirement Validation ‚úÖ
Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

## types of requirement

Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
Definition: Describe what the system should do.
Examples: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

Key Functional Requirements:

Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
User Registration: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
Property Listings: Display properties with essential details and images.
Booking System: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for users.
Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è
Definition: Describe how the system should perform.
Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

Key Non-functional Requirements:

Performance: The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
Security: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
Usability: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.

## Use case diagrams

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:

Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.
Ensure all functional requirements are captured before implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are predefined conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by the stakeholders, clients, or end-users. They clearly define what needs to be true for a feature or user story to be considered complete. In requirement analysis, acceptance criteria are crucial because they:

- Ensure **clarity** by setting a common understanding between stakeholders and developers.  
- Reduce **ambiguity** in requirements by providing measurable conditions.  
- Act as a **baseline for testing**, since they define the expected outcomes.  
- Help stakeholders **validate** that the delivered feature meets business needs.  
- Provide a way to **prioritize and track progress** during development.  

### Example: Checkout Feature in the Booking Management System

**Feature:** Checkout  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The system must allow a customer to proceed to checkout only if they have at least one valid booking in their cart.  
2. The customer must be able to view a summary of their booking (room type, dates, total price) before confirming.  
3. The system must support multiple payment options (e.g., credit card, mobile money).  
4. Payment details must be securely captured and processed through the payment gateway.  
5. The system must display a confirmation message and booking reference number after successful payment.  
6. An email notification with booking details must be sent to the customer upon completion.  
7. If payment fails, the system must display an error message and allow the customer to retry or choose a different payment method.

This way, the acceptance criteria make the **Checkout feature** testable, verifiable, and aligned with user expectations.
 Do you want me to also restructure your README.md so all sections (Requirement Analysis, Use Case Diagrams, Acceptance Criteria, etc.) flow in a clean project-report style, or should I just give you the snippets to paste as you go?
